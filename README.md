# Single Cycle MIPS Processor
An implementation of a 32-bit single-cycle microarchitecture MIPS processor based on Harvard Architecture. The single-cycle microarchitecture executes an entire instruction in one cycle. In other words instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, write back, and program counter update occurs within a single clock cycle.
